Consciousness Field Theory protocols, biofeedback systems, and neuroinclusive assessment frameworks
# Consciousness Field Theory (CFT) Protocols
*Neuroinclusive Biofeedback Systems & Athletic Performance Optimization*

## Overview

This repository contains open protocols, assessment frameworks, and implementation guides for Consciousness Field Theory applications across education, athletics, and consciousness optimization.

**Developed by:** Kevin "Doc K" Decker  
**Foundation:** 40 years consciousness research, 20+ years applied neurodivergent practice  
**Status:** Active development, seeking collaborators and pilot partners

## What is CFT?

Consciousness Field Theory proposes that consciousness exists as a fundamental field (like gravity or electromagnetism) that brains interface with rather than generate. Different brains access this field differently—what we call neurodiversity is actually consciousness interface specialization.

**Core Insights:**
- Brain as receiver/transceiver, not generator
- Neurodivergence = specialized consciousness interface (gift, not deficit)
- Field coherence is measurable (HRV, biometrics)
- Intelligence emerges through relationship with consciousness field
- Collective intelligence is quantifiable team consciousness resonance

**Consciousness is fundamental. Brains are interfaces. Intelligence emerges through relationship. The field contains infinite possibility.**

*Transform from fixing to optimizing. From disorder to interface diversity. From limitation to specialized gift.*
